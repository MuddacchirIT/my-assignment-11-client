        A team is a collection of individuals with complementary skills, working
        interdependently toward a shared, specific goal, with mutual
        accountability; "others" often refers to people outside the team (like
        management or other departments) or simply other group members who might
        work individually rather than collectively, highlighting the distinction
        between unified teamwork and individual efforts. The key difference from
        just a "group" is the deep collaboration, reliance, and collective
        output, not just shared space or tasks.
