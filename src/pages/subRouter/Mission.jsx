        A mission is a specific, important task, duty, or purpose assigned to a
        person or group, often guiding actions towards a larger goal, like a
        military operation, a space flight, or a company's reason for existing
        (its "mission statement" explains who they are, what they do, and for
        whom). It can also refer to a group of people sent to a foreign country
        for a specific reason, such as diplomatic talks or
        religious/humanitarian work.
