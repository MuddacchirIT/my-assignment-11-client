        A story is a narrative, true or fictional, describing a sequence of
        events or experiences, told through words, images, or performance to
        entertain, inform, or instruct, forming plots in literature, news, or
        personal accounts. It can be a simple anecdote, a complex novel, a short
        tale, or even a lie, but always involves characters, events, and a
        structure, often with a beginning, middle, and end, aiming to evoke
        feeling or deliver meaning, like in fables or short stories.
